# Uber-Trip-Data-Analysis
A dashboard and web application that allows users to explore, analyze, and visualize Uber trip data to gain insights into travel behavior, demand patterns, and peak usage times.

## About the Project:
The application provides an interactive interface where users can analyze Uber trip data by filtering on different attributes such as location, date, time of day, and trip category. The backend processes and analyzes the dataset to extract meaningful patterns, which are then displayed in an easy-to-understand format.

## Components of the Application:
- Date Range Selector – Choose a custom time frame to analyze trips.
- Location Filter – Analyze trips by pickup or drop-off locations.
- Time-of-Day Analysis – View trip demand across different times of the day.
- Category Filter – Separate trips into categories (e.g., Business vs. Personal).
- Visual Dashboards – Charts for trip frequency, distance analysis, and demand heatmaps.

## About the Model / Analysis:
The dataset used is Uber Trip Data. The analysis leverages Python data processing and visualization libraries to uncover insights, such as:
- Peak hours for Uber demand
- Most frequently visited pickup and drop-off locations
- Average trip durations and distances
- Business vs. personal usage trends

## Requirements:
The following libraries are required:
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- Numpy (numerical computations)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly (visualizations)
- Flask / Dash / Streamlit (for the interactive web interface)
- Scikit-learn (for additional modeling, if applying predictive analysis)
